     * <p>
     * <STRONG>Basic Idea: </STRONG>
     * <ul>
     *      <li> In a positional numeral system, a number is represented as a string of digits, where each digit's position represents a power of the radix. For example, in the decimal system (radix 10), the number 735 is represented as {@code 7Ã—10^2 + 3x10^1 + 5x10^0}. 
     *      <li>Radix sort takes advantage of this positional structure by sorting the elements digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD). </li></li>
     * 
     * </ul>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that works by distributing elements into buckets,
     * according to it's individual digits. It performs multiple passes over the input array, sorting the elements
     * based on their digits at different positions. During every pass all the array elements are sorted, based on their buckets(which are holding a particular  digit of array elements). In this way, in every pass a different digit(bucket) is considered and array elements are sorted. By this way when the final pass is completed, the array will be sorted.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In detail, this function calls the {@code radixCountSort} function for each digit position, starting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit. At every pass the array is sorted as per the particular exponent(digit). And there will be 'n' number of passes. Where 'n', is the number of digits the largest element of the array consists.
     * The working is just similar to that of the counting sort algorithm. But instead of considering each & entire element. This algorithm considers one digit after the other as discussed above. 
     * This special implementation can easily handle many problems that normal counting sort algorithm couldn't.

     *              <li> Counting Sort is most effective when the range of input values (the difference between the maximum and minimum values) is not significantly larger than the number of elements in the input array. If the range is much larger, the Counting Sort approach becomes less practical due to the memory requirements. </li>
     *              <li> Whereas, radix Sort can handle a larger range effectively by sorting digits at different positions independently. Each pass of Radix Sort considers one digit at a time, allowing it to handle numbers with a larger range more efficiently.

     * <li> <STRONG> Bucket Range Calculation: </STRONG>
     *      <ul>

     *      <ul>
     *          <li> Bucket sort operates on the assumption that the input elements are uniformly distributed across the range. This assumption is crucial for achieving good performance. </li>
     *          <li> In the distribution step, each element of the input array is placed into its corresponding bucket based on its value. The calculation of the bucket index is typically done using the formula (element - min) / bucketRange. The last bucket may need special handling to include the maximum value. </li>

     * <STRONG>Pros:- </STRONG>
     * <ul>
     *      <li> The algorithm allows users to specify the number of buckets (k), providing some flexibility in adapting to different scenarios. Users can experiment with different values of k to find an optimal setting. </li>  
     *      <li> Bucket sort is well-suited for scenarios where the input data is uniformly distributed across a known range. In such cases, it can achieve good performance. </li>
     *      <li> In the best-case scenario, where the input elements are uniformly distributed and the individual bucket sorting is efficient, the time complexity can approach linear time. This is advantageous for certain types of input data. </li>
     * </ul>
     * </p>
     * 
     * <STRONG>Cons:- </STRONG>
     * <ul>
     *      <li> Bucket sort is sensitive to the distribution of input elements. If the data is not uniformly distributed, some buckets may be significantly larger than others, leading to suboptimal performance. </li>  
     *      <li> The performance of the algorithm is influenced by the choice of sorting algorithm for individual buckets. If a less efficient sorting algorithm is used, it can impact the overall efficiency of the algorithm. </li>
     *      <li> The provided implementation is not in-place, meaning it requires additional space proportional to the size of the input array. This can be a drawback in situations where memory usage is a concern. </li>
     *      <li> Depending on the distribution of input data, some buckets may remain empty, leading to additional space overhead without contributing to the sorting process. </li>
     * </ul>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <STRONG>Note:- </STRONG> Bucket sort is often stable, meaning that the relative order of equal elements is preserved during the sorting process. This stability depends on the stability of the sorting algorithm used for individual buckets.
     * And the number of buckets used in the algorithm is a critical parameter. If the number of buckets is too small, it may lead to clustering of elements in the same bucket, affecting the efficiency of the algorithm. If it's too large, the overhead of managing numerous empty buckets could reduce performance.
     * The time complexity of bucket sort is influenced by the distribution of elements and the sorting algorithm used for individual buckets. In the best-case scenario, where the elements are evenly distributed, and the individual bucket sorting is efficient, the time complexity can be close to linear. Mostly the time complexity of this algorithm is ideal, when the available buckets are more.
     * But, the space complexity of bucket sort is dominated by the space required for the buckets. The overall space complexity is determined by the number of buckets and the space required for sorting individual buckets.
